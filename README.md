I made a Campground reviewing web app this summer with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and various packages that allows users to create accounts and post campground with it's location, pictures, and various other details.
The web app has full CRUD functionality allowing users to create, delete, edit, and view the campgrounds.
Other users can then view this campground listings and leave reviews. With PassportJS, I was able to implement user authentication and authorization to limit who can delete listings and reviews.
